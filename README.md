# SEIDR-S_Epidemic
 A model describing the evolution of an epidemic with social distancing.

#Netmutation.R

Is a function that simulates the spreading of the Virus under study, in a network object in R. The parameters are predetermined for the case of Covid-19 , based on the following work :https://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/333859/?ln=en


#SEIDR-S.m

A mathematica model simulating the macroscopic study of the virus spreading under the model presented here: https://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/333859/?ln=en

Since those agorithms are incuded in the PDF from of my thesis, the algorithms are copyright reserved.


#Further

More general versions of the algorithms are under development and will be released allowing the study of more infectious diseases
